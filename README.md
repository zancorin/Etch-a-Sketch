Using HTML / CSS / JAVASCRIPT
This program is a basic webpage that utilizes javascript to create a 16x16 div grid by manipulating the DOM and creating interactivity via event listeners. A button will allow the user to create divs based on user input up to a limit of 100. Event listeners are used to check if the user hovers over divs, and implements styles accordingly.
